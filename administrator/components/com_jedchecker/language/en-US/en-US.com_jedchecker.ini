COM_JEDCHECKER_RESULTS="JED Checker Results"
COM_JEDCHECKER_CONGRATS="Congratulations! If you use this component then you've most probably developed a Joomla! extension. Now comes the &quot;hard&quot; part - getting it listed in the Joomla Extension Directory (JED). The JED has strict requirements that must be complied with before an extension will be published in the directory. Those requirements can be found <a href='%s' target='_blank'>here</a>. This component has been built with the aim of simplifying the development process by automatically checking the code for common errors in extensions."
COM_JEDCHECKER_CODE_STANDARDS="However, this is not the only goal. We also aim to have code standards checks, such as those that the JPlatform has. This would ensure that Joomla extension developers are aware of the JPlatform coding standards and this could raise the quality bar in our Joomla community even higher. For this we will need you - have a look at the <a href='%s' target='_blank'>Github project page</a>. Fork the component, add your code checks and send us your pull requests!"

COM_JEDCHECKER_RULE_PH2="PHP Files missing JEXEC security"
COM_JEDCHECKER_RULE_PH2_DESC="All the PHP files in your extension needs to have a defined('_JEXEC') or die(); statement in the beginning of each file. This ensures that the file cannot be opened outside of the joomla installation and increases the security of your site."

COM_JEDCHECKER_RULE_ENCODING="Base64 or other type of encoding in the files"
COM_JEDCHECKER_RULE_ENCODING_DESC="As developers we are fully aware that the base64 and similar functions have a valid place in extensions (such as URL redirects or data storage). However if you use those to make it harder for users to read your code or to mask backlinks the JED will not accept your listing submission (this is not in the spirit of GPL anyway!). An editor will review your code and determine if the way you use the base64 matches the rules of the JED. This might slow your listing review time. So the rule of thumb is - don't do fishy stuff and avoid encoding your code if possible!"
